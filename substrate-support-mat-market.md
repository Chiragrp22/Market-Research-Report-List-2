<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Substrate Support Mat Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intumescent Substrate Support Mat</li><li>Non-Intumescent Substrate Support Mat</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Substrate support mat is a type of material used to provide structural support to various substrates in applications such as fire protection and insulation. There are two main types of substrate support mat in the market: intumescent and non-intumescent. </p><p>Intumescent substrate support mat is designed to expand when exposed to heat or fire, forming a protective barrier that helps prevent the spread of flames and heat to the underlying substrate. It is commonly used in fireproofing applications to enhance the fire resistance of walls, ceilings, and other structures.</p><p>Non-intumescent substrate support mat, on the other hand, does not expand when exposed to heat or fire. It provides support and insulation to the substrate without the additional fire protection capabilities of intumescent mat. It is commonly used in various insulation applications, such as thermal insulation of pipes, ducts, and equipment.</p><p>Both intumescent and non-intumescent substrate support mats play crucial roles in different applications, providing support and protection to various substrates depending on the specific needs of each project.</p></p>
