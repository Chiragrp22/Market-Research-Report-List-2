<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluid-applied Waterproofing Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Fluid-applied Waterproofing Membrane</li><li>Hot Fluid-applied Waterproofing Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fluid-applied waterproofing membranes are used to prevent water intrusion in buildings and structures. Two types of these membranes are cold fluid-applied and hot fluid-applied. Cold fluid-applied membranes are applied at ambient temperatures, eliminating the need for heat, making them easier to install and more cost-effective. On the other hand, hot fluid-applied membranes require the application of heat during installation. They offer superior adhesion and are commonly used for high-performance applications where resistance to extreme temperatures is required. Both types provide effective waterproofing solutions but differ in their application methods and performance characteristics.</p></p>
