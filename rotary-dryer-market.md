<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct-heated Rotary Dryer</li><li>Indirect Rotary Dryer</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Rotary dryer market types include direct-heated and indirect rotary dryers. Direct-heated rotary dryers involve a direct contact between the drying medium and the material being dried, resulting in high drying efficiency. They are commonly used for drying bulk solids, such as ores, minerals, and granular materials. On the other hand, indirect rotary dryers use a heat transfer medium to indirectly heat the material. This is suitable for drying heat-sensitive materials and for situations where direct contact between the drying medium and material must be avoided, such as certain chemicals or food products.</p></p>
