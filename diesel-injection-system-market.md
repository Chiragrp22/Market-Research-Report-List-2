<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diesel Injection System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Diesel Injection System</li><li>Indirect Diesel Injection System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Diesel Injection System market includes two types: Direct Diesel Injection System and Indirect Diesel Injection System. Direct Diesel Injection System directly supplies fuel into the combustion chamber, resulting in better fuel efficiency, power delivery, and lower emissions. On the other hand, Indirect Diesel Injection System delivers fuel to a pre-chamber where it ignites and then transfers to the main combustion chamber. Although indirect injection is less efficient, it offers smoother operation, reduced noise levels, and lower production costs compared to direct injection.</p></p>
