<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bentonite Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sodium Bentonite</li><li>Calcium Bentonite</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Bentonite market is divided into two main types: Sodium Bentonite and Calcium Bentonite. Sodium Bentonite is a type of clay that swells when mixed with water, forming a gel-like substance. It is commonly used in drilling muds, sealants, and binding agents. Calcium Bentonite, on the other hand, does not swell as much as Sodium Bentonite and is used in various industries such as livestock feed, ceramics, and construction. Both types have unique properties and applications in different sectors of the market.</p></p>
