<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Copper Foil Shielding Tape Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Sided</li><li>Double Sided</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Copper foil shielding tape is categorized into two types: single-sided and double-sided. Single-sided copper foil shielding tape consists of a layer of copper foil on one side, while the other side is adhesive-coated. This tape provides electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding by effectively grounding and blocking out unwanted electrical signals. On the other hand, double-sided copper foil shielding tape has copper foil on both sides, making it more effective in creating a complete shield against EMI. Both types have their respective applications in various industries requiring EMI protection.</p></p>
