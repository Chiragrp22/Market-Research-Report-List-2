<p><ul><li>Stump Grinding</li><li>Stump Removal</li></ul></p>

Stump grinding involves using a machine to grind the stump down into small wood chips, which are then used as mulch. This method is quicker and less expensive than removal, making it a popular choice. Stump removal, on the other hand, involves completely removing the stump from the ground, including the roots. This method is more labor-intensive and time-consuming, but ensures the complete eradication of the stump. Both options provide effective solutions for eliminating unwanted stumps.</p></p>
