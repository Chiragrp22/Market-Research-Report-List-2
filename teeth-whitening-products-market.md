<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Teeth Whitening Products Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Surface Whiteners</li><li>Bleaches</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Teeth whitening products market consists of two primary types: surface whiteners and bleaches. Surface whiteners are non-bleaching agents designed to remove surface stains on teeth. They work by using mild abrasives or chemicals that break down stains. On the other hand, bleaches contain peroxide-based chemicals that can penetrate the tooth's enamel and alter the color of the deeper layers. They are more effective in treating deep stains and can provide more noticeable results. Both types of products are widely available in the market to cater to different consumer needs for achieving a brighter smile.</p></p>
