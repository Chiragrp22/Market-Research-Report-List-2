<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Concrete Pump Trucks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Piston Mode</li><li>Squeeze Mode</li><li>Hydraulic Diaphragm Mode</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Concrete pump trucks are used in construction for efficiently transferring liquid concrete to high-rise buildings or hard-to-reach areas. There are three types: piston mode, squeeze mode, and hydraulic diaphragm mode. In the piston mode, a reciprocating motion is created by the piston, allowing concrete to be pumped. In the squeeze mode, a rotating roller squeezes the flexible pipe, pushing out the concrete. In the hydraulic diaphragm mode, the concrete is propelled by a hydraulic system that activates a diaphragm, pushing it into the pipeline.</p></p>
