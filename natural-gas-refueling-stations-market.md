<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Gas Refueling Stations Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CNG</li><li>LNG</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Natural gas refueling stations are divided into two market types based on the type of gas they dispense: CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) and LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas). CNG stations compress natural gas to high pressures, allowing for more efficient storage and refueling of vehicles equipped with CNG tanks. LNG stations, on the other hand, cool natural gas to extremely low temperatures until it becomes a liquid, which takes up less space, making it suitable for long-haul trucks or marine vessels. Both CNG and LNG market types provide alternative fuel options and contribute to the expansion of the natural gas refueling infrastructure.</p></p>
