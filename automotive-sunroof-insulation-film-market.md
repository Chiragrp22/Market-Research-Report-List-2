<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Sunroof Insulation Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solar Control</li><li>Convection Control</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive sunroof insulation film market includes two main types: solar control and convection control. Solar control films are designed to minimize heat and UV radiation from entering the vehicle, helping to keep it cool and protecting the interior from fading. Convection control films, on the other hand, aim to reduce the heat transfer through convection, which is the movement of hot or cold air. These films help in maintaining a comfortable temperature inside the vehicle by blocking the airflow between the sunroof and the interior space.</p></p>
