<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Flasher Module Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electronic Flasher</li><li>Thermal Flasher</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive flasher module market consists of two main types - electronic flashers and thermal flashers. Electronic flashers are powered by an electronic circuit that controls the flashing rate of the car's turn signals. They offer various features such as adjustable flash rate and compatibility with LED lights. On the other hand, thermal flashers rely on a bi-metallic strip that heats up and cools down, causing the turn signals to flash. They are commonly used in older vehicles and have a fixed flash rate. Both types play an essential role in regulating the flash rate of turn signals in automobiles.</p></p>
