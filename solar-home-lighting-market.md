<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Home Lighting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Grid-Tied Solar Home Lighting</li><li>Off-Grid Solar Home Lighting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solar home lighting market consists of two types: grid-tied and off-grid systems. Grid-tied solar home lighting systems are connected to the main electrical grid, allowing excess electricity generated by solar panels to be fed back into the grid. This enables households to reduce their electricity bills and potentially earn money by selling surplus electricity. On the other hand, off-grid solar home lighting systems are not connected to the grid and operate independently. These systems rely solely on solar power and typically include battery storage to provide electricity during nighttime or cloudy days.</p></p>
