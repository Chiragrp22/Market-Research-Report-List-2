<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical CPR Machine</li><li>Automated CPR Machine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Machine market consists of two main types: Mechanical CPR Machines and Automated CPR Machines. Mechanical CPR Machines are designed to perform chest compressions manually by healthcare professionals. They require the user to physically compress the patient's chest, providing external support during cardiac arrest. On the other hand, Automated CPR Machines function automatically, relying on technology to deliver consistent chest compressions. These machines automate the compression process, allowing for continuous and uninterrupted chest compressions, reducing the fatigue factor for healthcare professionals.</p></p>
