<p><h1>Electrically Actuated Butterfly Valves Market Size, Growth and Forecast from 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Market Overview and Report Coverage</strong></p>
<p><p>Electrically actuated butterfly valves are flow control devices that are used to regulate the flow of fluid through a piping system. These valves are operated electrically, allowing for remote control and automation. Electrically actuated butterfly valves consist of a circular disc or vane that is mounted on a shaft. When the valve is open, the disc is positioned parallel to the pipe, allowing for unrestricted flow. When the valve is closed, the disc rotates perpendicular to the pipe, blocking the flow.</p><p>The electrically actuated butterfly valves market is expected to witness significant growth in the coming years. The growing demand for efficient flow control solutions in various industries such as water and wastewater, oil and gas, and chemical is driving the market. Additionally, the increasing adoption of automation and remote control systems in these industries is further fueling the demand for electrically actuated butterfly valves.</p><p>The market forecast for electrically actuated butterfly valves is positive, with a projected CAGR of 4.7% during the forecast period. The market growth can be attributed to factors such as the increasing need for precise flow control, the benefits of electric actuation over manual actuation (such as ease of operation and reduced maintenance), and the advancements in valve technology.</p><p>The latest market trends in the electrically actuated butterfly valves market include the integration of smart valve technologies, such as IoT-based monitoring and control systems, to enhance operational efficiency. Manufacturers are also focusing on developing valves with improved sealing mechanisms and reduced leakage to meet strict regulatory requirements.</p><p>In conclusion, the electrically actuated butterfly valves market is poised for steady growth in the coming years. The factors driving market growth include the increasing demand for efficient flow control solutions and the adoption of automation and remote control systems. With advancements in valve technology and the integration of smart valve technologies, the market is expected to witness further growth.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrically Actuated Butterfly Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wafer Type</li><li>Lug Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The electrically actuated butterfly valves market includes two main types: wafer type and lug type. Wafer type valves are designed to fit between two flanges, while lug type valves have threaded inserts on both sides, allowing them to be bolted into a system. Both types use an electric actuator to control the valve's opening and closing. Wafer type valves are more common and cost-effective for low-pressure applications, while lug type valves offer added stability and can be used in high-pressure systems.</p></p>
