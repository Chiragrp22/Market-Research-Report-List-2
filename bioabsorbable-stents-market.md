<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bioabsorbable Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Peripheral Bioabsorbable Stents</li><li>Coronary Bioabsorbable Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bioabsorbable stents are medical devices used in the treatment of blocked blood vessels. Peripheral bioabsorbable stents are specifically designed for treating blockages in peripheral arteries, mainly in the lower extremities. They gradually dissolve over time, allowing the artery to heal naturally. On the other hand, coronary bioabsorbable stents are used for treating blockages in the heart's coronary arteries. These stents are made of biodegradable materials and are absorbed by the body after a period, eliminating the need for long-term placement and potential complications associated with permanent stents.</p></p>
