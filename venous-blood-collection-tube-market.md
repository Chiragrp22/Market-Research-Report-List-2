<p><strong>The Venous Blood Collection Tube Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anticoagulant</li><li>Coagulant</li><li>No Additives</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Venous blood collection tubes are used in medical settings for collecting blood samples. Anticoagulant tubes contain additives that prevent blood from clotting, ensuring the sample remains in a liquid state. Coagulant tubes, on the other hand, promote blood clotting, allowing for the separation of serum from the clotted blood. No additives tubes are used when the blood sample requires no further treatment or preservation. These different types of tubes cater to various laboratory requirements, allowing for accurate testing and analysis of blood samples.</p></p>
