<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable Gas Chromatography Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gas-solid chromatography (GSC)</li><li>Gas-liquid chromatography (GLC)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Portable gas chromatography (GC) is a versatile analytical technique used for the separation and identification of volatile compounds in gas samples. Gas-solid chromatography (GSC) is a type of GC where the sample interacts with a solid adsorbent material, allowing for the separation of components based on their affinity towards the adsorbent. On the other hand, gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) utilizes a liquid stationary phase coated on a solid support, which interacts with the sample and separates its components based on their partition between the stationary and mobile phases. Both GSC and GLC have applications in various industries, including environmental monitoring, forensic analysis, and pharmaceuticals.</p></p>
