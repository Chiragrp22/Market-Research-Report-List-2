<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Kids Flossers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Waxed Type</li><li>Unwaxed Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Kids Flossers market can be divided into two main types: waxed and unwaxed. Waxed flossers have a coating of wax that makes them smooth and easier to glide between teeth, reducing the chances of fraying or breaking. They are preferable for kids with tighter teeth or those new to flossing. On the other hand, unwaxed flossers lack this coating, making them suitable for children who prefer a natural feel or have wider gaps between their teeth. Both types offer effective cleaning and contribute to maintaining good oral hygiene.</p></p>
