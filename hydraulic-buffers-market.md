<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydraulic Buffers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tap</li><li>Vertical</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Hydraulic buffers are often classified into two types: tap buffers and vertical buffers.</p><p>Tap buffers, also known as piston buffers, are installed on the end of the faucet spout or tap, providing a smooth and controlled closing of the tap. It helps reduce noise and water hammering caused by sudden stops, extending the lifespan of the faucet and preventing damage to plumbing systems. Tap buffers are commonly used in residential and commercial settings.</p><p>Vertical buffers are typically installed in vertical pipe systems, such as those found in high-rise buildings or industrial applications. These buffers provide a similar function as tap buffers, minimizing the impact of sudden water flow changes and reducing noise and vibrations within the piping network.</p><p>Both tap and vertical buffers use hydraulic mechanisms to regulate water flow, ensuring a gentle and controlled closing or flow rate transition, thus safeguarding the plumbing and improving overall system performance.</p></p>
