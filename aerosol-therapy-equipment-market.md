<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aerosol Therapy Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metered Dose Inhalers (MDIs)</li><li>Dry Powder Inhalers (DPIs)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aerosol therapy equipment encompasses various devices used for delivering medication directly to the lungs. Metered Dose Inhalers (MDIs) are commonly used and consist of a pressurized canister that releases a precise dose of medication when activated. Dry Powder Inhalers (DPIs) are another type, which deliver powdered medication that needs to be inhaled forcefully. MDIs are more user-friendly and require less patient coordination compared to DPIs. Both types of inhalers are crucial in treating respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p></p>
