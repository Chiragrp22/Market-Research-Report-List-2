<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RFID Tag/Label Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>RFID Tag/Label Market consists of two types: Active and Passive. Active RFID tags have their power source and transmit signals actively, enabling longer read ranges and real-time tracking capabilities. They are mainly used in applications that require frequent and long-range data transmission. On the other hand, Passive RFID tags rely on the energy received from the RFID reader to transmit data. They are more cost-effective, smaller, and have a shorter read range, making them suitable for applications that do not require real-time tracking or long-distance communication.</p></p>
