<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial X-ray Film for Non-destructive Testing (NDT) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Screen Type Films</li><li>Screen Type Films</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Industrial X-ray film for non-destructive testing (NDT) is used to detect flaws or defects in materials or products without causing any damage. There are two types of market segments - non-screen type films and screen type films. Non-screen type films are designed for direct exposure to X-rays, providing high contrast images suitable for detecting small defects. Screen type films use a phosphor screen between the X-ray film and the source, converting X-rays into visible light and offering greater sensitivity for thicker materials.</p></p>
