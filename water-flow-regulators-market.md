<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Flow Regulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Constant Pressure Regulator</li><li>Pressure Reducing Regulator</li><li>Boost Regulator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Water Flow Regulators Market comprises three types of regulators, namely Constant Pressure Regulators, Pressure Reducing Regulators, and Boost Regulators. Constant Pressure Regulators maintain a steady water pressure level, preventing any fluctuations in the flow. Pressure Reducing Regulators decrease the high inlet water pressure to a lower, more manageable level. Boost Regulators, on the other hand, increase the low inlet water pressure to a higher level. These regulators play a crucial role in maintaining optimal water flow in various applications, such as residential, commercial, and industrial settings.</p></p>
