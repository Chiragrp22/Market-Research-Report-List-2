<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bevel Gearbox Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Straight Bevel Gearbox</li><li>Spiral Bevel Gearbox</li><li>Zerol Bevel Gearbox</li><li>Hypoid Bevel Gearbox</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Bevel Gearbox Market Types:</p><p>1. Straight Bevel Gearbox: This type of gearbox has straight-cut teeth that intersect with the axis of rotation. It offers high efficiency but can produce noise and vibration.</p><p>2. Spiral Bevel Gearbox: With curved teeth and a spiral shape, these gearboxes provide smoother, quieter operation than straight bevel gearboxes. They excel in high-speed applications and have increased load-carrying capacity.</p><p>3. Zerol Bevel Gearbox: Similar to spiral bevel gearboxes, zerol gearboxes have curved teeth. However, they have a smaller spiral angle, reducing thrust load and increasing tooth strength.</p><p>4. Hypoid Bevel Gearbox: Hypoid gearboxes have spiral bevel gears with non-intersecting axes. They are designed for high torque applications and offer high efficiency while reducing noise and vibration.</p></p>
