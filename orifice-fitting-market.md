<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Orifice Fitting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dual Chamber Orifice Fitting</li><li>Single Chamber Orifice Fitting</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Orifice Fitting market consists of two primary types: Dual Chamber Orifice Fittings and Single Chamber Orifice Fittings. Dual Chamber Orifice Fittings involve two chambers or compartments separated by a diaphragm, allowing for accurate measurement of flow rates. This design is suitable for applications requiring reduced pressure drop and increased accuracy. On the other hand, Single Chamber Orifice Fittings have only one chamber, making them simpler in design and more cost-effective. They are commonly used in applications where high accuracy is not critical, and cost-efficiency is a priority.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Orifice Fitting Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Measurement</li><li>Gas Measurement</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The orifice fitting market finds applications in both liquid measurement and gas measurement sectors. In liquid measurement, orifice fittings are used to accurately determine the flow rate of liquids in a pipeline. Similarly, in gas measurement, they help in precisely calculating the gas flow rate. These fittings function by creating a constriction in the pipeline, which leads to a pressure drop. This pressure drop is then measured to determine the flow rate, enabling efficient monitoring and control of liquid and gas flows in various industrial processes.</p></p>
