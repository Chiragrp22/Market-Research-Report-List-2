<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Scrubber Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Technology</li><li>Dry Technology</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Scrubber Systems market consists of two major types, namely Wet Technology and Dry Technology. Wet Technology scrubbers use a liquid to trap pollutants from gas streams, typically through a process of absorption or reaction. These scrubbers are effective in removing gases like sulfur dioxide and hydrogen chloride. On the other hand, Dry Technology scrubbers use a dry substance, such as activated carbon or lime, to capture pollutants. These scrubbers are suitable for removing particulate matter and pollutants like mercury. Both types of scrubber systems play a crucial role in reducing air emissions and improving air quality.</p></p>
